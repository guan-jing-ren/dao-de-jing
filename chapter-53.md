Efficient composition
===
```
If I have a little knowledge
Walking on the great Tao
I fear only to deviate from it
The great Tao is broad and plain
But people like the side paths
```
- If I have a little understanding  
Parsing the Lambda Calculus  
I fear only having to manage state  
The great Lambda is reentrant and composable  
But programmers like the side effects  
```
The courts are corrupt
The fields are barren
The warehouses are empty
```
- The stacks are corrupted  
The computation is deadlocked  
The pipelines are empty  
```
Officials wear fineries
Carry sharp swords
Fill up on drinks and food
Acquire excessive wealth
```
- Programmers launch threads  
Share mutable references  
Fill up on objects and garbage  
Acquire excessive locks  
```
This is called robbery
It is not the Tao!
```
- This is called garbage collection  
It is not Computation!
