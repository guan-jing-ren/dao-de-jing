Coming into life, entering death
The followers of life, three in ten
The followers of death, three in ten
Those whose lives are moved toward death
Also three in ten
Why? Because they live lives of excess
```
- Coming into mathematics, entering coding  
The followers of functions, three in ten  
The followers of objects, three in ten  
Those whose software are moved towards hardware  
Aso three in ten  
Why? Because they program for runtime

I've heard of those who are good at cultivating life
Traveling on the road, they do not encounter rhinos or tigers
Entering into an army, they are not harmed by weapons
Rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horns
Tigers have nowhere to clasp their claws
Soldiers have nowhere to lodge their blades
Why? Because they have no place for death
```
- I've heard of those who are good at metaprogramming  
Pushing to production, they do not encounter nulls or exceptions  
Designing generic systems, they are not intruded on by inheritance  
Programmers have nowhere to input invalid arguments  
Interpreters have nowhere to leave garbage  
Code monkeys have nowhere to construct uninitialized values    
Why? Because they have no place for runtime errors
