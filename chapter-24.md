No Boilerplate
===
```
Those who are on tiptoes cannot stand  
Those who straddle cannot walk  
Those who flaunt themselves are not clear  
Those who presume themselves are not distinguished  
Those who praise themselves have no merit  
Those who boast about themselves do not last  
```
- Those who mutate cannot be shared  
Those who lock cannot scale  
Those who expose inner details are not cohesive  
Those who architect do not design  
Those who certify have no code  
Those who follow fads do not last  
```
Those with the Tao call such things leftover food or tumors  
They despise them  
Thus, those who possesses the Tao do not engage in them  
```
- Those who solve problems call such things boilerplate code and XML  
They despise them  
Thus, those who solve problems do not produce them
