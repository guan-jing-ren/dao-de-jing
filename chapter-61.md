Freedom
===
```
The large country is like the lowest river
The converging point of the world
The receptive female of the world
The female always overcomes the male with serenity
Using serenity as the lower position
Thus if the large country is lower than the small country
Then it can take the small country
If the small country is lower than the large country
Then it can be taken by the large country
Thus one uses the lower position to take
The other uses the lower position to be taken
The large country only wishes to gather and protect people
The small country only wishes to join and serve people
So that both obtain what they wish
The larger one should assume the lower position
```
- The free project is like the lowest river  
The master repository of the pull requesters  
The pull request merger of the fork repositories  
The master repository always overcomes the forks with contributors  
Using contributions as the freer position  
Thus if the small project is freer than the large project  
Then it can overtake the large project  
If the large project is freer than the small project  
Then it can merge with the small project  
Thus one uses the freer position to get ahead  
The other uses the freer position to be merged  
The free project only wishes to gather and protect contributors  
The closed project only wishes to spread and gain users  
So that both obtain what they wish  
The large one should assume the freer position
